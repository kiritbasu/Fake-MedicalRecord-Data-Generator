# Fake-MedicalRecord-Data-Generator

Just a simple script to generate fake PII rich data that looks like parts of a medical record.

To install :

- Install NodeJS

- `npm install chance`
- `npm install cluster`

(the last param is the number of concurrent threads you want to run to generate a lot of data in parallel)
- `node medicalrecord-data-gen.js 1`
